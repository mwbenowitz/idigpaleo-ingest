# iDigPaleo Ingest Tool
This script automates ingest of records from provider institutions' IPTs into the [iDigPaleo](idigpaleo.org) projects. It can be run on a one time basis or as a recurring task.

Though designed for the iDigPaleo project it could be used to automate ingest for any paleontological or zoological collections into CollectiveAccess.
